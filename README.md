Web Worker and Service Worker Developer Notes

##### Web Workers API
A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. Worker()) that runs a named JavaScript file â€” this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current window. Thus, using the window shortcut to get the current global scope (instead of self) within a Worker will return an error. <br/>

##### Service Worker API
Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs. <br/>
